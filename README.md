# YouScience Code Challenge

**Fork** this repo on GhitHub (please save as a **private repo**)

## Project Setup

This repository is split into a web app directory (eg `/frontend`) and server directory `/backend`.

The `/backend` directory is where you'll create your nodejs server using express.

If applying for a backend position, use the `/backend`.
If applying for a frontend, feel free to use both.

This project does not utilize _create-react-app_ so feel free to show us any talents you may have, front end or back end. 

## Instructions

See the [Front end instructions](frontend/README.md) for frontend focused instructions. 

See the [Back end instructions](backend/README.md) for backend focused instructions.
